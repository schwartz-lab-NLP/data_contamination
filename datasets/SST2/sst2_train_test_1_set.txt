it 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .  1

as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j. barry is perfectly creepy and believable .  1
it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .  0
it 's all surface psychodramatics .  0
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .  0

sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard .  0
and there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene 's story ends .  1
a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .  0
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .  0
the leanest and meanest of solondz 's misanthropic comedies .  1
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .  0
the movie is about as deep as that sentiment .  0

if there 's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .  0
clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable ...  1
bravado kathy !  1

hardly a film that comes along every day .  1
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .  0
especially give credit to affleck .  1
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .  0
derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .  0
the acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans .  1
it 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah .  0
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd .  0
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...  0
... the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form .  1
they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .  0
an energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up .  1
fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .  1
time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .  0
a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .  1
this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -lrb- as well as a serious debt to the road warrior -rrb- , but it feels like unrealized potential  1
as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .  1
it 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .  1
i 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper .  0
hey , happy !  1
a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .  1
this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part .  1
promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish .  1
manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .  0
this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer .  1
while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out .  1
the campy results make mel brooks ' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated .  1
but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert .  1
who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds .  1
the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .  1
if you open yourself up to mr. reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change .  1
-lrb- jeff 's -rrb- gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams 's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent .  1
the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects .  1
because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin .  1
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .  0
first-time director joÃ£o pedro rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .  0
it 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .  0
the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .  0

it 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .  0
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -lrb- ahola -rrb- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .  0
reminiscent of alfred hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen .  1
a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .  0
what 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .  0
weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .  1
the film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .  1
no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .  1
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .  0

otto-sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye .  1
what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .  0

i 'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid .  0
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut dahmer -lrb- jeremy renner -rrb- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .  0
rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .  1
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .  0
the film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking .  0

the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .  1

stealing harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .  0
one of the worst films of 2002 .  0

with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi 's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives .  1
sweetly sexy , funny and touching .  1
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .  0
the result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .  0

the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .  0
but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold .  1

deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .  0

cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .  0
best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .  1
even at its worst , it 's not half-bad .  1
there 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .  1
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .  0
what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance .  1

an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds .  1
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls '' and last year 's `` rollerball . ''  1

leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .  1
begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .  1
below is well below expectations .  0
each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .  1

i have a confession to make : i did n't particularly like e.t. the first time i saw it as a young boy .  0
the story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr. day-lewis roars with leonine power .  1
a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .  0
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .  0
less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling -lrb- though no less horrifying for it -rrb- .  1
the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .  0
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .  0

the movie does n't generate a lot of energy .  0
lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .  0

the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .  0
even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .  0
despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie  0
humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath 's version of ` nicholas nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful .  1
